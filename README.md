# Attachments
The **Attachments** module brings to the OpenMRS Reference Application a central place to manage file attachments.
<br>Additionally it encompasses files uploaded elsewhere within OpenMRS as long as they are saved as [complex obs](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Creating+Complex+Observations+and+Concepts).

### A central place for attachments management
In a nutshell Attachments is a '**complex obs management** module' ready to be extended to further content types and concept complex coded obs.
